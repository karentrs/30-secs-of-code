<!--1.
    In order to write JavaScript code, we need a script element.
    There are two places where we can add a script element. We can place this eleemt either in the 
    Head or Body section. The best practice is to place this at the end of the Body section after all the existing elements.
    Why?1. The Teh browser passes the file from top to bottom. It won't be able to render the contents of the page, which is 'Hello World'.
        2. The code used in teh script element refers to the elements on the page.
