//Comment
//means you want to LOG 'Hello World' in the console. All statements end with a ';'.

//This is my first JavaScript code.
console.log('Hello World');

//HTML includes the content while JavaScript implements how the content behaves.
//we can either open command prompt, write cd space, then the file path, or you can open the terminal and follow
//the same steps. 

//to declare a variable use 'let'/cannot be a reserved keyword/should be meaningful
let name='Mosh';
console.log(name);

const interestRate = 0.3;
// will get an error bc using const does not let you change the value of the variable
interestRate = 1;
console.log(interestRate);

//primitives = string, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null
let name = 'Mosh'; // String Literal
let age = 30; //Number Literal
let isApproved = true; //Boolean Literal
let firstName = undefined; //value is undefined;
let lastName = null; //use null when we want the value of the variable to be clear

//javascript is a dynamic language. The value of a variable can change.
